# DSCI 554 Assignment: Evaluate and Create Dashboards

## Description

### Objective

In this assignment you will create a simple dashboard to present information for five countries using data of your choice. The repository includes a `package.json` initialized with `npm init`.

## Country Data Dashboard

### Dataset: United Nations data of your choice

1. **Data Collection**
   - Select data of your choice for five countries to use for the dashboard
   - Research dashboards on a similar topic and data
   - Download or fetch the necessary datasets

2. **Dashboard Design**
   - Define who is the user and create user stories for the use cases you will implement
   - Create a wireframe of the design with an SVG tool
   - Improve the design with features from dashboards on a similar topic and data
   - Discuss your design choices (e.g., KPIs, layout, color scheme, visualizations...)
   - Use the visualization wheel to evaluate your design
   - Include at least a table, a bar chart, a scatterplot, a line chart
   - Apply appropriate visual encoding techniques to enhance information communication.

3. **Dashboard Implementation**
   - Using vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap implement the screens of your dashboard as individual pages, using `index.html` as the home page.
   - Use separate JavaScript files for the graphics you create
   - Implement using D3 data join at least a table, a bar chart, a scatterplot, a line chart.
   - Use D3 axes, with well formatted tick mark labels, axis labels and title.
   - load data in JSON or CSV format
   - Use Bootstrap to customize the page according to your design

## Submission

- Document your dashboard design and important implementation details in a Google Slide presentation.
- Provide a link to the Google Slide in `README.md`
- Include all the source design files (wireframe, color palette, etc.) in the submission.
- Ensure that the dashboard is functional and displays correctly in Google Chrome and that there are no errors in DevTools.

| **Sophisticated** | Well-designed dashboard with clear user stories containing features from similar dashboards on same topic/data (4-5 pts) | Well-implemented dashboard, using well vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap for all screens, separate files for each graphic, implemented using D3 data join at least a table, a bar chart, a scatterplot and a line chart. Using D3 axes with well formatted tick mark labels, axis labels and title. (4-5 pts) |
